# 🔑 KeyPaths in Rust

Key paths and case paths provide a **safe, composable way to access and modify nested data** in Rust.
Inspired by **Swift's KeyPath / CasePath** system, this feature rich crate lets you work with **struct fields** and **enum variants** as *first-class values*.

---

## 🚀 New: Static Dispatch Implementation

**We now provide two implementations:**

### Primary: `rust-keypaths` + `keypaths-proc` (Recommended)
- ✅ **Static dispatch** - Faster performance, better compiler optimizations
- ✅ **Write operations can be faster than manual unwrapping** at deeper nesting levels
- ✅ **Zero runtime overhead** - No dynamic dispatch costs
- ✅ **Better inlining** - Compiler can optimize more aggressively
- ✅ **Functional chains for `Arc<Mutex<T>>`/`Arc<RwLock<T>>`** - Compose keypaths through sync primitives
- ✅ **parking_lot support** - Optional feature for faster locks

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-keypaths = "1.1.0"
keypaths-proc = "1.1.0"
```

### Legacy: `key-paths-core` + `key-paths-derive` (v1.6.0)
- ⚠️ **Dynamic dispatch** - Use only if you need:
  - `Send + Sync` bounds for multithreaded scenarios
  - Dynamic dispatch with trait objects
  - Compatibility with existing code using the enum-based API

```toml
[dependencies]
key-paths-core = "1.6.0"  # Use 1.6.0 for dynamic dispatch
key-paths-derive = "1.1.0"
```
---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Readable/Writable keypaths** for struct fields
- ✅ **Failable keypaths** for `Option<T>` chains (`_fr`/`_fw`)
- ✅ **Enum CasePaths** (readable and writable prisms)
- ✅ **Composition** across structs, options and enum cases
- ✅ **Iteration helpers** over collections via keypaths
- ✅ **Proc-macros**: `#[derive(Keypaths)]` for structs/tuple-structs and enums, `#[derive(Casepaths)]` for enums
- ✅ **Functional chains for `Arc<Mutex<T>>` and `Arc<RwLock<T>>`** - Compose-first, apply-later pattern
- ✅ **parking_lot support** - Feature-gated support for faster synchronization primitives

---

## 📦 Installation

### Recommended: Static Dispatch (rust-keypaths)

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-keypaths = "1.1.0"
keypaths-proc = "1.1.0"
```

### With parking_lot Support

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-keypaths = { version = "1.1.0", features = ["parking_lot"] }
keypaths-proc = "1.1.0"
```

### API Differences

**rust-keypaths (Static Dispatch):**
```rust
use rust_keypaths::{KeyPath, OptionalKeyPath, WritableKeyPath};

let kp = KeyPath::new(|s: &Struct| &s.field);
let opt_kp = OptionalKeyPath::new(|s: &Struct| s.opt_field.as_ref());
let writable_kp = WritableKeyPath::new(|s: &mut Struct| &mut s.field);
```

## 🚀 Examples

### Deep Nested Composition with Box and Enums

This example demonstrates keypath composition through deeply nested structures with `Box<T>` and enum variants:

```rust
use keypaths_proc::{Casepaths, Keypaths};

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths)]
#[Writable]
struct SomeComplexStruct {
    scsf: Box<SomeOtherStruct>,
}

impl SomeComplexStruct {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            scsf: Box::new(SomeOtherStruct {
                sosf: OneMoreStruct {
                    omsf: String::from("no value for now"),
                    omse: SomeEnum::B(DarkStruct {
                        dsf: String::from("dark field"),
                    }),
                },
            }),
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths)]
#[Writable]
struct SomeOtherStruct {
    sosf: OneMoreStruct,
}

#[derive(Debug, Casepaths)]
#[Writable]
enum SomeEnum {
    A(String),
    B(DarkStruct),
}

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths)]
#[Writable]
struct OneMoreStruct {
    omsf: String,
    omse: SomeEnum,
}

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths)]
#[Writable]
struct DarkStruct {
    dsf: String,
}

fn main() {
    use rust_keypaths::WritableOptionalKeyPath;
    
    // Compose keypath through Box, nested structs, and enum variants
    // Using .then() method (works on stable Rust)
    let keypath = SomeComplexStruct::scsf_fw()
        .then(SomeOtherStruct::sosf_fw())
        .then(OneMoreStruct::omse_fw())
        .then(SomeEnum::b_case_fw())
        .then(DarkStruct::dsf_fw());
    
    // Alternatively, use the >> operator (requires nightly feature):
    // #![feature(impl_trait_in_assoc_type)]
    // let keypath = SomeComplexStruct::scsf_fw()
    //     >> SomeOtherStruct::sosf_fw()
    //     >> OneMoreStruct::omse_fw()
    //     >> SomeEnum::b_case_fw()
    //     >> DarkStruct::dsf_fw();
    
    let mut instance = SomeComplexStruct::new();
    
    // Mutate deeply nested field through composed keypath
    if let Some(dsf) = keypath.get_mut(&mut instance) {
        *dsf = String::from("we can update the field of struct with the other way unlocked by keypaths");
        println!("instance = {:?}", instance);
    }
}
```

### Functional Chains for Arc<Mutex<T>> and Arc<RwLock<T>>

Compose keypaths through synchronization primitives with a functional, compose-first approach:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, RwLock};
use keypaths_proc::{Keypaths, WritableKeypaths};

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths, WritableKeypaths)]
struct Container {
    mutex_data: Arc<Mutex<DataStruct>>,
    rwlock_data: Arc<RwLock<DataStruct>>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Keypaths, WritableKeypaths)]
struct DataStruct {
    name: String,
    optional_value: Option<String>,
}

fn main() {
    let container = Container::new();
    
    // Read through Arc<Mutex<T>> - compose the chain, then apply
    Container::mutex_data_r()
        .chain_arc_mutex(DataStruct::name_r())
        .get(&container, |value| {
            println!("Name: {}", value);
        });
    
    // Write through Arc<Mutex<T>>
    Container::mutex_data_r()
        .chain_arc_mutex_writable(DataStruct::name_w())
        .get_mut(&container, |value| {
            *value = "New name".to_string();
        });
    
    // Read through Arc<RwLock<T>> (read lock)
    Container::rwlock_data_r()
        .chain_arc_rwlock(DataStruct::name_r())
        .get(&container, |value| {
            println!("Name: {}", value);
        });
    
    // Write through Arc<RwLock<T>> (write lock)
    Container::rwlock_data_r()
        .chain_arc_rwlock_writable(DataStruct::name_w())
        .get_mut(&container, |value| {
            *value = "New name".to_string();
        });
}
```

**Available chain methods:**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `chain_arc_mutex(keypath)` | Read through `Arc<Mutex<T>>` |
| `chain_arc_mutex_optional(keypath)` | Optional read through `Arc<Mutex<T>>` |
| `chain_arc_mutex_writable(keypath)` | Write through `Arc<Mutex<T>>` |
| `chain_arc_mutex_writable_optional(keypath)` | Optional write through `Arc<Mutex<T>>` |
| `chain_arc_rwlock(keypath)` | Read through `Arc<RwLock<T>>` (read lock) |
| `chain_arc_rwlock_optional(keypath)` | Optional read through `Arc<RwLock<T>>` |
| `chain_arc_rwlock_writable(keypath)` | Write through `Arc<RwLock<T>>` (write lock) |
| `chain_arc_rwlock_writable_optional(keypath)` | Optional write through `Arc<RwLock<T>>` |

**Running the example:**
```bash
cargo run --example readable_keypaths_new_containers_test
```

### parking_lot Support

For faster synchronization with `parking_lot::Mutex` and `parking_lot::RwLock`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-keypaths = { version = "1.1.0", features = ["parking_lot"] }
```

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use parking_lot::{Mutex as ParkingMutex, RwLock as ParkingRwLock};

// Chain methods for parking_lot (feature-gated)
Container::parking_mutex_data_r()
    .chain_arc_parking_mutex(DataStruct::name_r())
    .get(&container, |value| {
        println!("Name: {}", value);
    });

Container::parking_rwlock_data_r()
    .chain_arc_parking_rwlock_writable(DataStruct::name_w())
    .get_mut(&container, |value| {
        *value = "New name".to_string();
    });
```

**Key advantage:** parking_lot locks **never fail** (no poisoning), so chain methods don't return `Option` for the lock operation itself.

**Running the example:**
```bash
cargo run --example parking_lot_chains --features parking_lot
```

## 💡 Why use KeyPaths?

* Avoids repetitive `match` / `.` chains.
* Encourages **compositional design**.
* Plays well with **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** and **Actor-based systems**.
* Useful for **reflection-like behaviors** in Rust (without unsafe).
* **High performance**: Only 1.46x overhead for reads, **93.6x faster** when reused, and **essentially zero overhead** for deep nested writes (10 levels)!

## ⚡ Performance

KeyPaths are optimized for performance with minimal overhead. Below are benchmark results comparing **direct unwrap** vs **keypaths** for 10-level deep nested access:

| Operation | Direct Unwrap | KeyPath | Notes                         |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| **Read (10 levels)** | **384.07 ps** | **848.27 ps** | ~464 ps absolute difference   |
| **Write (10 levels)** | **19.306 ns** | **19.338 ns** | **Essentially identical!** ⚡ |

## 🔄 Comparison with Other Lens Libraries

### Limitations of lens-rs, pl-lens, and keypath

Both **lens-rs**, **pl-lens** (Plausible Labs), and **keypath** have several limitations when working with Rust's type system, especially for nested structures:

#### keypath limitations:
1. **❌ No enum variant support**: No built-in support for enum case paths (prisms)
2. **❌ No Option<T> chain support**: Requires manual `.and_then()` composition for Option types
3. **❌ Limited container support**: No built-in support for `Result<T, E>`, `Mutex<T>`, `RwLock<T>`, or collection types
4. **❌ No failable keypaths**: Cannot easily compose through Option chains with built-in methods
5. **❌ No writable failable keypaths**: Missing support for composing writable access through Option chains
6. **❌ Limited composition API**: Less ergonomic composition compared to `.then()` chaining
7. **⚠️ Maintenance status**: May have limited active maintenance

#### pl-lens limitations:
1. **❌ No support for `Option<Struct>` nested compositions**: The `#[derive(Lenses)]` macro fails to generate proper lens types for nested structs wrapped in `Option<T>`, requiring manual workarounds
2. **❌ Limited enum support**: No built-in support for enum variant case paths (prisms)
3. **❌ No automatic failable composition**: Requires manual composition through `.and_then()` chains for Option types
4. **❌ Limited container support**: No built-in support for `Result<T, E>`, `Mutex<T>`, `RwLock<T>`, or collection types
5. **❌ Named fields only**: The derive macro only works with structs that have named fields, not tuple structs
6. **❌ No writable failable keypaths**: Cannot compose writable access through Option chains easily
7. **❌ Type system limitations**: The lens composition through Option types requires manual function composition, losing type safety

#### lens-rs limitations:
1. **❌ Different API design**: Uses a different lens abstraction that doesn't match Rust's ownership model as well
2. **❌ Limited ecosystem**: Less mature and fewer examples/documentation
3. **❌ Composition complexity**: More verbose composition syntax

### Key Advantages of rust-keypaths

1. **✅ Native Option support**: Built-in failable keypaths (`_fr`/`_fw`) that compose seamlessly through `Option<T>` chains (unlike keypath, pl-lens, and lens-rs which require manual composition)
2. **✅ Enum CasePaths**: First-class support for enum variant access (prisms) with `#[derive(Casepaths)]` (unique feature not found in keypath, pl-lens, or lens-rs)
3. **✅ Container types**: Built-in support for `Result`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Arc`, `Rc`, `Box`, and all standard collections (comprehensive container support unmatched by alternatives)
4. **✅ Functional chains for sync primitives**: Compose keypaths through `Arc<Mutex<T>>` and `Arc<RwLock<T>>` with a clean, functional API
5. **✅ parking_lot support**: Feature-gated support for faster `parking_lot::Mutex` and `parking_lot::RwLock`
6. **✅ Zero-cost abstractions**: Static dispatch with minimal overhead (1.46x for reads, near-zero for writes) - benchmarked and optimized
7. **✅ Comprehensive derive macros**: Automatic generation for structs (named and tuple), enums, and all container types
8. **✅ Swift-inspired API**: Familiar API for developers coming from Swift's KeyPath system with `.then()` composition
9. **✅ Deep composition**: Works seamlessly with 10+ levels of nesting without workarounds (tested and verified)
10. **✅ Type-safe composition**: Full compile-time type checking with `.then()` method
11. **✅ Active development**: Regularly maintained with comprehensive feature set and documentation

### Example: Why rust-keypaths is Better for Nested Option Chains

**pl-lens approach** (requires manual work):
```rust
// Manual composition - verbose and error-prone
let result = struct_instance
    .level1_field
    .as_ref()
    .and_then(|l2| l2.level2_field.as_ref())
    .and_then(|l3| l3.level3_field.as_ref())
    // ... continues for 10 levels
```

**rust-keypaths approach** (composable and type-safe):
```rust
// Clean composition - type-safe and reusable
let keypath = Level1::level1_field_fr()
    .then(Level2::level2_field_fr())
    .then(Level3::level3_field_fr())
    // ... continues for 10 levels
    .then(Level10::level10_field_fr());
    
let result = keypath.get(&instance); // Reusable, type-safe, fast
```
